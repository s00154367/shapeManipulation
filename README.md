Client Side Scripting 2
Assignment 1 – 20%

Part A – 40%
Write a piece of code which will take in book data for a library via an appropriately styled HTML
form. The specific data is to be decided by yourself but would obviously include book name,
publisher and ISBN. Have a button called “Store” which should store the book to local storage. If
other books have already been stored this book should be appended to that list. Call the HTML file
“bookstore.htm”. Data should be stored in such a fashion as to allow for use by other applications if
required. Have a second HTML file called “bookRetrieve.htm” which will load all books currently
stored in local storage (again, appropriately styled). A “Clear Storage” button should also be included
which will clear all local storage. (20%)
On the “bookRetrieve.htm” page have a mechanism for deleting one or more books such that local
storage will be updated so as not to include any deleted books. (10%). Be able to delete a book by at
least two options (10%).

Part B – 50%
Write a piece of HTML5 (“Shapes.htm”) which takes in enough coordinates (and any other
information) to allow you to create a shape via the HTML5 canvas. The actual shape is to be decided
by yourself (you can make up your own). Higher marks are available for more complex shapes. When
the coordinates/details are taken in they are to be stored to local storage. Create a second HTML
page (“Render.htm”) which will dynamically render the shape by reading the storage. (35%)
Also have on the page a styled rectangular div. When the shape is dropped into the div a sound
should play and both the shape and div should be removed from the page DOM, and storage should
be cleared. (15%)

Part C – 10%
Create a unique jQuery animation. In the code documentation, explain why you believe it to be
unique.
Note: As this is an Inquiry based assignment, it is expected that you will reference the web for help
on various topics. However, please note the following;

- All sites you obtain information from must be referenced in the html file where the
information is used, this must include a link to the site and an overview of what you
obtained from the site, including the original code of any code snippets used
- You are prohibited from posting any questions, in any form, or communicating with
anyone regarding the assignment
- You must document your code – if you cannot get code working you should explain in the
HTML file issues you tried to resolve, evidence of debugging (e.g. console.log) and
anything else (e.g. code which was documented out to allow program to partially work)
that demonstrates your attempts at solving the problem.
- You may use jQuery.

Marking Overview:
- Evidence of concise, clear, well documented coding
- Use of appropriate data storage
- Well-designed pages (distinction)
- Multiple inputs for rendering of shape
- Complex shape or shapes (distinction)
- Evidence of research
- Evidence of advanced research / application of advanced concepts (distinction)
- Advanced animation (distinction)
- Creativity for data input (Distinction)
